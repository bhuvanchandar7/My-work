### **Project Overview: Ray Tracing Renderer in C**

The goal of this project is to design and implement a basic **ray tracing renderer** from scratch using the **C programming language**. Ray tracing is a technique for rendering 3D images by simulating how light interacts with objects in a virtual scene. The project involves building the renderer step-by-step, culminating in the generation of a 3D image featuring spheres, lighting, shadows, and realistic color rendering.

### **Key Concepts and Components**

1. **Vectors and Geometry in 3D Space**:
   - Use 3D vectors to represent points, directions, and colors in the scene.
   - Implement operations such as addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and normalization.

2. **Ray Representation**:
   - Represent a ray mathematically using its origin and direction.
   - Cast rays from the camera into the scene to determine if they intersect objects (e.g., spheres).

3. **Camera and Viewport**:
   - Position the camera at the origin and create a viewport as a 2D projection plane in 3D space.
   - Map rays from the camera through each pixel on the viewport.

4. **Objects and Materials**:
   - Represent spheres with attributes such as position, radius, and color.
   - Dynamically manage the spheres using a data structure to handle variable numbers of objects.

5. **Light and Shadows**:
   - Introduce a single light source with a position and intensity.
   - Compute shading on objects based on their orientation relative to the light source.
   - Handle shadows by casting additional rays to check for obstructions.

6. **Ray-Sphere Intersection**:
   - Implement mathematical algorithms to check if a ray intersects a sphere.
   - Calculate intersection points and determine which sphere is closest to the camera.

7. **Color and Lighting**:
   - Represent colors using RGB values and compute lighting intensity based on distance and surface orientation.
   - Include shadowing effects by reducing brightness when objects are in shadow.

8. **Anti-Aliasing**:
   - Enhance the image quality by sampling each pixel multiple times and averaging the results to reduce jagged edges.

9. **File I/O**:
   - Input scene parameters (e.g., camera settings, light, spheres, and colors) from a file.
   - Output the rendered image as a **PPM file** (a simple image format) for visualization.

### **Final Output**

The final program produces a rendered 3D image of spheres in a scene, illuminated by a single light source. The image includes:
- Realistic lighting with smooth shading.
- Shadows cast by objects.
- Full-color rendering with anti-aliasing to improve image quality.

### **Project Highlights**

- **Low-Level Programming**:
  - Implement vector and matrix operations manually.
  - Manage dynamic memory and optimize for performance in C.
  
- **Graphics and Visualization**:
  - Simulate real-world lighting and shading phenomena like diffuse reflection and shadows.

- **File Handling**:
  - Parse input files and write output in a structured image format.

- **Algorithmic Thinking**:
  - Solve geometric problems like ray-sphere intersection and vector mathematics.
